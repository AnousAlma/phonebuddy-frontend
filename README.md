# How to use the frontend

## Startup
First create a .env file to the main folder.

.env should be formatted in the following way:

      

    REACT_APP_API_URL=YOUR_API_URL_HERE

## Running the frontend

After you are done with setup all you have to do is run

    npm start
in the console and thats it :)
